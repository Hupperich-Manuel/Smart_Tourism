If you are adding a new table:

Delete the database and create a new one. Remember to change the password host name etc.
Then:

git add .

git commit -m "changes in migrations"

git push heroku main

heroku run python manage.py migrate (the tables from polls app wont migrate)

python manage.py makemigrations

python manage.py migrate

Hopwfully heroku does also change
